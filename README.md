# NServiceBus.UniformSession

Provides a uniform API for accessing messaging operations in library code, similar to `IBus` in NServiceBus 5 and lower, that works whether or not the current code is in a message handler context with an `IMessageHandlerContext` or outside a message handler context with an `IMessageSession`.
