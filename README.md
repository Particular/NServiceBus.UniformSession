# NServiceBus.UniformSession

NServiceBus.UniformSession provides a uniform API for accessing messaging operations in library code, similar to `IBus` in NServiceBus 5 and lower. It works whether or not the current code is in a message handler context with an `IMessageHandlerContext` or outside a message handler context with an `IMessageSession`.

It is part of the [Particular Service Platform](https://particular.net/service-platform), which includes [NServiceBus](https://particular.net/nservicebus) and tools to build, monitor, and debug distributed systems.

## Official documentation

See the [Uniform Session documentation](https://docs.particular.net/nservicebus/messaging/uniformsession) for more details on how to use it.
